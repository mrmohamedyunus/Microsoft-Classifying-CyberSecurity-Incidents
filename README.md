### Microsoft Cybersecurity Incident Classification
**Author:** Mohamed Yunus

#### Project Overview
The Microsoft Cybersecurity Incident Classification project aims to enhance the efficiency of Security Operation Centers (SOCs) by developing a sophisticated machine learning model to predict the triage grade of cybersecurity incidents. The model categorizes incidents into True Positive (TP), Benign Positive (BP), or False Positive (FP), enabling SOC analysts to prioritize and respond to threats with greater accuracy and efficiency.

#### Data Exploration and Understanding
**Purpose:** To gain insights into the dataset’s structure, feature types, target variable distribution, and inherent patterns.
- **Key Steps:**
  - Loaded and examined the dataset (`train.csv`).
  - Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify patterns, correlations, and anomalies within the data.

#### Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering
**Purpose:** To prepare the dataset for effective modeling by addressing missing values and enhancing feature sets.
- **Key Steps:**
  - Managed missing data through imputation or removal of affected rows.
  - Engineered new features and encoded categorical variables to improve model performance.

#### Data Splitting
**Purpose:** To divide the dataset into training and validation sets for assessing model performance.
- **Key Steps:**
  - Implemented an 80/20 train-validation split.
  - Applied stratified sampling to preserve class distribution across splits.

#### Model Selection and Training
**Purpose:** To identify and train effective machine learning models for incident classification.
- **Models Used:**
  - **Baseline Models:** Logistic Regression, Decision Trees.
  - **Advanced Models:** Random Forests, Gradient Boosting Machines (including XGBoost and LightGBM), Neural Networks.
- **Key Steps:**
  - Performed hyperparameter tuning using RandomizedSearchCV.
  - Conducted k-fold cross-validation to ensure robust model evaluation.

#### Model Evaluation and Tuning
**Purpose:** To assess and fine-tune models based on performance metrics.
- **Key Metrics:** Macro-F1 Score, Precision, Recall.
- **Key Steps:**
  - Utilized SMOTE to address class imbalance.
  - Evaluated model performance on the validation set to optimize configurations.

#### Model Interpretation and Feature Importance
**Purpose:** To understand the influence of different features on model predictions.
- **Method Used:** LightGBM’s built-in feature importance analysis.
- **Key Steps:**
  - Calculated and interpreted feature importance scores to assess their impact on predictions.

#### Error Analysis
**Purpose:** To examine misclassifications and identify potential areas for model improvement.
- **Key Steps:**
  - Analyzed misclassified cases to understand and address sources of error.

#### Final Evaluation on Test Set
**Purpose:** To test the model’s generalizability and robustness on an independent dataset.
- **Key Steps:**
  - Evaluated the final model on a separate test set.
  - Compared results to baseline performance to assess improvements.

#### Reporting
**Purpose:** To document the project’s methodology and provide actionable recommendations.
- **Sections:**
  - **Model Documentation:** Detailed rationale for model choices, encountered challenges, and optimization strategies.
- **Recommendations:**
  - **Integration into SOC Workflows:** Automate the triage and prioritization process.
  - **Continuous Improvement:** Regularly update the model with new data.
  - **Feature Engineering and Refinement:** Enhance model performance by incorporating additional features.
  - **Handling Class Imbalance:** Explore advanced techniques like cost-sensitive learning to manage class imbalance.
  - **Real-World Deployment:** Address computational requirements and real-time data processing needs.
